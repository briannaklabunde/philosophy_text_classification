# Classifying Philisophical Text by School of Thought Using NLP and Machine Learning 

This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to classify philosophical texts according to their **school of thought** â€” such as Stocism, German Idealism, and Phenomenology. It explores how linguistic patterns and semantic features can reveal philosophical alignment in written works.

## Project Overview

Philosophical writing varies across schools of thought â€” from reason-based argumentation to experience-centered reflection.  
This project uses **text classification** and **topic modeling** to analyze and predict which school of thought a given passage or philosopherâ€™s writing belongs to.

Key steps include:
- Text cleaning and preprocessing
- **Unsupervised topic modeling using LDA** (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) for exploratory data analysis
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF and Count Vectorization
- Supervised classification (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, plus additional Boosting & Bagging models)   
- Evaluation and visualization of model performance
